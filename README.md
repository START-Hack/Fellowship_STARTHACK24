**<p align="center"> Centralizing START Fellowship Ecosystem: A Unified Platform Approach </p>**

<br>

## <p align="center"> Case Introduction: </p>

**<p align="left"> Problem </p>**

START Fellowship is a student-run accelerator and incubator aimed at empowering young entrepreneurs from low- and middle- income countries through an interdisciplinary program. Every year we bring around 35 startups for 4 months to Switzerland and help them to accelerate their startup. Over the last four Batches we encountered different problems regarding monitoring the progress of the startups. We face fragmented communication and resource tracking across the START Fellowship Community and the Accelerator Batches. Mainly distributed across Notion, Slack, Whatsapp and LinkedIn, leading to inefficient data handling within START Fellowship.

**<p align="left"> Expected final product </p>**

A comprehensive platform that centralizes all the information about the startups from the current and the previous batches. The goal is that START Fellowship Team as well as the key stakeholders (strategic partners, investors, mentors etc.)  can track the progress of the startups. The centralized database should streamline data handling and improve the current CRM structure. ([the Y-Combinator Startup Directory](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies?batch=S23) can serve as an example)  
As additional features the Hack Team can think of ways to integrate some of the following processes into the platform:

+ Application Process: Currently on Hubspot 
+ Request Forms: currently on Asana 
+ Mentor & Coaching Pool
+ Partner Database
+ Dashboard for the Fellows
+ Event organization
+ Community engagement
+ START Fellowship communication
+ etc. (be creative and surprise us)

**<p align="left"> Users of this solution </p>**

+ START Global Alumni & Team: The Team which is organizing the START Fellowship Accelerator and needs to keep track of the progress/success of the startups
+ START Fellows: The founders of the startups in the current Batch
+ START Fellow Alumni: Former START Fellows from the previous Batches
+ Partners/Mentors from START Fellowship: Key Stakeholders who want to monitor the success of the startups
+ START Chapters (mainly Bogota, Quito, Lima): sub student organizations, who are representing START Global in their country

We are heavily reliant on SaaS products in our enterprise stack, so API connections are a must. 
Our current stack is the following:
+ Communication: Slack & Google Workspace
+ CRM + Website: HubSpot
+ Data: Airtable + Zoho (+ Zapier)
+ Documentation: Notion
+ Task Management: Asana
Donâ€™t be afraid to build on open source software!


**<p align="left"> Use Case (and Business Case) </p>**
The platform will serve as the central organ for START Fellowship Incubator/Accelerator/Comunity, enhancing UI-platform use for START Fellows, Team, and partners to engage during the current cohort and community later.
